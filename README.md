# Dimensional-Motion
Algorims to analyze data with noise or complex speeds. Deals with acceleration, speed, trends, and maxes and mins. Based off of an AP Physics lab. 


Overview: Task is to analyze data collected in a physics lab. Will assess the following:
 The total time
 The distance traveled
 The average speed for the whole trip
 The maximum speed and the time at which this occurred
 The range of time values when the object was: speeding up, moving at a
constant speed, and slowing down
 The average acceleration for when the object was speeding up and slowing
down
